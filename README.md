# File_Encryption_By_QuantumKey
A simple application that runs a local server. User requests to receive a 256-bit key and use it to encrypt and decrypt a simple txt file using AES algorith.

Step 1: install the libraries below using "pip install"

Libraries: request, dotenv, pycryptodome, flask

Step 2: Run the "mock-qkd-device.py" file to open your local server

Step 3: Run the "encryption.py" file to encrypt your file.txt. you can overwrite the file to test any text off your choice to encrypt

Step 4: You can see in the same folder 2 extra files. one for the encrypted file and one for the decrypted file
